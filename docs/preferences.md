## Core Concepts

### What is a User Preference?

A user preference is any piece of information about a user that might be relevant for future conversations. This includes:

- **Likes/Dislikes**: Things the user enjoys or doesn't enjoy
- **Expertise Areas**: Skills or knowledge the user possesses
- **Experience Levels**: How much experience the user has in certain areas
- **Goals**: What the user is trying to achieve
- **Challenges**: Problems the user is facing
- **Tools**: Technologies or tools the user works with
- **Learning Interests**: Topics the user wants to learn about
- **Personal Traits**: Characteristics of the user

### Preference Structure

Each preference consists of:

- **Type**: The category of preference (expertise, goal, like, etc.)
- **Value**: The specific information (Python programming, building web apps, etc.)
- **Confidence**: A score from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating how confident the system is
- **Context**: Why this preference was extracted
- **Metadata**: Additional information about when/where it was extracted

## Preference Extraction Process

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **User Sends a Message**:
   - The message is received by the API or CLI interface
   - If a user_id is provided, the system will save preferences to the database

2. **Message Processing**:
   - The `add_user_message` method in `ChatBot` class processes the message
   - The message is added to the conversation history

3. **Preference Analysis**:
   - The `analyze_for_preferences` method is called
   - Recent conversation context is gathered (last 5 messages)
   - A prompt is constructed for the LLM to extract preferences

4. **LLM Analysis**:
   - The prompt is sent to the OpenAI API using a smaller model (default: gpt-4o-mini)
   - The LLM identifies potential preferences in the message
   - Each preference is assigned a confidence score
   - Only preferences with high confidence (typically >0.8) are returned

5. **Preference Storage**:
   - For each extracted preference:
     - A simplified version is added to message metadata as `preference: "{type} {value}"`
     - If a user_id is provided, the full preference is saved to the database
   - The message with metadata is saved to the conversation history table

6. **Response Generation**:
   - When generating a response, the system loads active preferences
   - Preferences are grouped by type and added to the system prompt
   - The LLM uses these preferences to personalize its response

### When Are Preferences Extracted?

Preferences are analyzed for **every user message**, but not every message will yield preferences. The system is designed to be conservative - it only extracts preferences when it's highly confident they represent genuine user traits or characteristics.

For example:
- "Hello" → No preferences extracted (generic greeting)
- "I've been working with Python for 5 years" → Preference extracted (expertise)
- "I'm trying to build a web application" → Preference extracted (goal)

## Storage Architecture

### Dual Storage Approach

The system uses a dual approach to storing preferences:

1. **Message Metadata**:
   - Each message can have a `preference` field in its metadata
   - Format: `"{type} {value}"` (e.g., "expertise Python")
   - Stored in the `conversation_history` table
   - Available even without a user_id
   - Limited to the conversation session

2. **User Preferences Database**:
   - Full preferences stored in the `user_preferences` table
   - Includes type, value, confidence, context, timestamps, etc.
   - Only saved if a user_id is provided
   - Persists across multiple sessions
   - Can be managed through API endpoints

### Database Schema

The `user_preferences` table has the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  preference_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  preference_value TEXT NOT NULL,
  context TEXT,
  confidence FLOAT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  last_used TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  source_session TEXT,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  metadata JSONB
);
```

### Smart Merging

When a preference similar to an existing one is detected:

1. The confidence score is updated to the maximum of the two scores
2. The context information is merged
3. The `last_used` timestamp is updated
4. Any new metadata is added to the existing metadata

This prevents duplicate preferences while enriching existing ones with new context.

## Confidence Scores

### What is a Confidence Score?

The confidence score is a value between 0.0 and 1.0 that indicates how certain the system is about a preference. It's determined by the LLM during preference extraction.

### Score Ranges

- **0.95 - 1.0**: Very high confidence - explicit statements (e.g., "I love Python")
- **0.85 - 0.94**: High confidence - strong implications (e.g., "I've been using Python daily for years")
- **0.75 - 0.84**: Moderate confidence - reasonable inferences (e.g., "I usually reach for Python when solving problems")
- **0.65 - 0.74**: Low confidence - possible but uncertain (e.g., "Python seems interesting")
- **< 0.65**: Very low confidence - typically not extracted

### How Scores Are Used

1. **Filtering**: By default, only preferences with confidence ≥ 0.7 are used in responses
2. **Prioritization**: Higher confidence preferences are given more weight
3. **Conflict Resolution**: When preferences conflict, the higher confidence one is preferred
4. **Retention**: Higher confidence preferences are more likely to be retained long-term

### Score Determination

The LLM determines confidence scores based on:

1. **Explicitness**: How directly the user stated the preference
2. **Consistency**: Whether it aligns with previous statements
3. **Recency**: More recent statements get higher confidence
4. **Specificity**: More specific statements get higher confidence

## API Endpoints

}
```

## Memory Management

### Preference Limits

The system does not have a hard limit on the number of preferences it can store for a user. However, there are practical considerations:

1. **Token Limits**: The LLM has a context window limit (typically 8K-32K tokens)
2. **Relevance Decay**: Older preferences may become less relevant over time
3. **System Prompt Size**: Too many preferences can make the system prompt unwieldy

### How Many Preferences Are Used?

When generating responses, the system:

1. Retrieves all active preferences with confidence ≥ 0.7
2. Updates the `last_used` timestamp for each preference
3. Groups preferences by type
4. Adds them to the system prompt

There is no fixed limit, but in practice:
- Most users will have 5-20 active preferences
- The system prompt can comfortably handle 30-50 preferences
- Beyond that, performance may degrade due to token limits

### Long-Term Memory

Preferences are designed to be long-term memory. A preference expressed a month ago will still be available if:

1. The same user_id is used
2. The preference has not been deactivated or deleted
3. The preference had a high confidence score

### Preference Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Extracted from conversation or manually added
2. **Usage**: Retrieved and used in system prompts
3. **Updates**: Merged with similar preferences, confidence potentially increased
4. **Deactivation**: Marked as inactive (soft delete)
5. **Deletion**: Permanently removed from the database

### Automatic Preference Management

Currently, the system does not automatically prune or deactivate preferences. This is a potential area for future enhancement:

- Automatically deactivate preferences not used for X months
- Reduce confidence of preferences over time
- Implement a preference conflict resolution system
- Add preference versioning to track changes

## CLI Commands

The chat interface includes several commands for managing user preferences directly from the command line:

### Viewing Preferences

```
preferences
```

Displays a table of all active preferences for the current user, including:
- ID
- Type
- Value
- Confidence
- Context
- Last Used timestamp

### Adding Preferences

```
add preference <type> <value> [confidence]
```

Manually adds a new preference for the current user.

**Examples:**
```
add preference like Python
add preference expertise JavaScript 0.85
add preference goal "Learn machine learning"
```

If confidence is not specified, it defaults to 0.9.

### Deleting Preferences

```
delete preference <id>
```

Deletes a specific preference by ID.

**Example:**
```
delete preference 5
```

### Clearing All Preferences

```
clear preferences
```

Deletes all preferences for the current user after confirmation.

### Help

```
help
```

Displays a list of all available commands, including the preference management commands.

### Important Notes

- Preference commands are only available when a user ID is provided (using `--user` when starting the chat).
- If no user ID is provided, the system will display a message explaining that preferences are only stored for identified users.
- Preferences added via CLI are marked with the context "Manually added via CLI" and include metadata indicating they were manually added.

- Visual indicators for preference usage
- Real-time preference updates

## Examples

### Example 1: Extracting Multiple Preferences

**User Message:**
```
I have been working as a software engineer for 5 years, mostly with backend systems. I am trying to learn more about frontend development because I want to build full-stack applications.
```

**Extracted Preferences:**
```json
[
  {
    "preference_type": "experience",
    "preference_value": "5 years in software engineering",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "context": "User mentioned having 5 years of experience as a software engineer"
  },
  {
    "preference_type": "expertise",
    "preference_value": "backend systems",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "context": "User has mostly worked with backend systems"
  },
  {
    "preference_type": "learning interest",
    "preference_value": "frontend development",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "context": "User is trying to learn more about frontend development"
  },
  {
    "preference_type": "goal",
    "preference_value": "building full-stack applications",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "context": "User wants to build full-stack applications"
  }
]
```

### Example 2: Using Preferences in Responses

**Response:**
```
Since you're interested in learning more about frontend development and enjoy working with TypeScript, focusing on technologies that complement these interests would be beneficial. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It has a strong community and ecosystem, and you can use it with TypeScript for type safety.

2. **Angular**: A platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Since you enjoy TypeScript, Angular might be a good fit.

3. **Vue.js**: Another progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It is known for its simplicity and flexibility, and you can use it with TypeScript as well.

4. **CSS Frameworks**: Learning a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS can help you design responsive and visually appealing interfaces quickly.

5. **Frontend Tools**: Familiarize yourself with tools like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint, which are commonly used in frontend development for bundling, transpiling, and linting code.

These technologies should give you a strong foundation in frontend development and help you build full-stack applications. Let me know if you need more detailed information on any of these!

## Best Practices

### When to Use User Preferences

1. **Long-term Users**: For users who will have multiple conversations over time
2. **Personalized Experiences**: When customization based on user traits is important
3. **Technical Support**: To remember user's technical environment and skills
4. **Learning Platforms**: To track user's progress and interests

### When Not to Use User Preferences

1. **Anonymous Chats**: For one-off conversations with anonymous users
2. **Privacy-Sensitive Contexts**: When storing user information raises privacy concerns
3. **Simple Q&A Systems**: For basic question-answering without personalization

### Tips for Effective Preference Management

1. **Use Consistent User IDs**: Ensure the same user_id is used across sessions
2. **Balance Specificity**: Too general preferences aren't useful, too specific ones don't apply broadly
3. **Regular Cleanup**: Periodically review and clean up outdated preferences
4. **Preference Hierarchy**: Organize preferences in a logical hierarchy by type
5. **Confidence Thresholds**: Adjust min_confidence based on your application's needs

### Security and Privacy Considerations

1. **Data Minimization**: Only store preferences that provide value
2. **User Control**: Allow users to view and manage their stored preferences
3. **Transparency**: Be clear about what information is being stored
4. **Data Protection**: Implement appropriate security measures for user data
5. **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with relevant privacy regulations
